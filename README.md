## Technology-Tool-Stack

- **React** : React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

- **Bootstrap** : Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions.

- **Count-up** : CountUp.js is a dependency-free, lightweight JavaScript class that can be used to quickly create animations that display numerical data in a more interesting way.
